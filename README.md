# Detector
The Detector is a custom tool, implemented using Python and Scapy, that is designed to determine whether a TCP SYN or a UDP Denial of Service attack are detected, given a packet capture file as input. It was developed as part of my thesis project for my degree of Bachelor of Science in Informatics of the Athens University of Economics and Business.
